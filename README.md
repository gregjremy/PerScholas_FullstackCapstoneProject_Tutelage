# TUTELAGE: A Full-Stack Project
A full-stack app that let's users connect with one another for tutoring purposes.

This is a project I did as my Capstone project as a Per Scholas Software Engineering intern. The purpose of Tutelage is to give potential learners access to instructors from all around the world. Tutees simply fill out an online form detailing the instruction that they need and when they are available, then submit it to the app. The submission then gets loaded onto a board that potential Tutors have access to. The limitations of business hours and geographic location are no longer a factor when it comes to getting the help and instruction that you need. With Tutelage, those who need tutoring can get tutoring; whenever and wherever!
